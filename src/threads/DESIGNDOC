---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

/* One sleeping thread's semaphore lock, as part of a list */
struct sleeping_thread {
  struct list_elem elem; /* List Element */
  struct semaphore semaphore; /* Semaphore */
  int64_t wake_time; /* Time to wake this thread */
};

Purpose: Store semaphores associated with sleeping threads in a list.

/*list of sleeping threads */
static struct list sleeping_threads_list;

Purpose: Store the list of sleeping_thread structs, ordered by wake time.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

The function starts with ensuring a correct environment
(e.g. interrupts are on, sleep_ticks > 0, ...).

Then we create an instance of our sleeping_thread struct and
initialize the semaphore with a value of 0, and set wake_time.
The reason we set the semaphore's value to 0 is that it allows us
to automatically block on it, and then wake when it is signaled.
The wake_time is simply the current number of timer_ticks + the
sleep time, which is expressed in terms of ticks and passed in as a 
param to this function. 

Then we disable interrupts to add our struct to the list of
sleeping thread structs. The reason we disable interrupts is to 
ensure that no race conditions happen between insertion into the 
sleeping_threads_list and removal from the sleeping_threads_list. 
Because the timer interrupt handler consults this list, our only
option is to disable interrupts, as interrupt handlers cannot block
and thus cannot acquire locks/semaphores...

Finally, with interrupts re-enabled,
we call sema_down. Because we initialize the semaphore to 0, this
causes the thread to block, until the timer interrupt handler calls
sema_up, and effectively wakes the thread from its sleep. 

The timer interrupt handler has an important role in this process. Threads
go to sleep in the timer_sleep function by calling sema_down on the semaphore
they themselves set to 0. The timer interrupt handler is responsible for
waking these threads up by calling sema_up on the semaphores contained
in each sleeping_thread for which wake time has been reached. 

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

As we have learned in class and from the documentation of the assignment, 
one of the goals of system programming is to minimize the amount of time
spent in an interrupt handler, because that will cause a thread to burn cpu
time. Thus, in the timer interrupt handler, we are conscience of this timing
issue. With respect to the process of timer_sleep, the timer interrupt handler 
is responsible for waking up the threads who's wake times have been reached. To 
reduce the amount of time spent in the timer interrupt handler with this task, 
we do the following:
- When adding a new sleeping_thread to the sleeping_threads_list, we use the
insert comparison function sleeping_thread_insert_func, to ensure that threads
are inserted in order according to their wake_time. The earliest wake times are
placed at the front of the list, and the later the times, the farther back in the 
list the thread will be. 
- When the timer interrupt handler reaches the code to wake up the sleeping
threads, it looks at the front of the list only. If the wake time of the thread
at the front of the list has been reached, the timer interrupt handler will
singal that thread to wake up by calling sema_up on the semaphore in the sleeping_thread. 
The timer interrupt hanlder than repeats this process, until it reaches a thread who's wake time has not been reached, or gets to the end of the list. In the case of the
first wake time that has not been reached, because the sleeping_thread_list is ordered
by wake time, we know all sleeping_threads that follow have equal to or later
wake times, and thus we can end our traversal of this list and move on to 
the next responsibility in the time interrupt handler.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
