			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

The site struct tracks additional information for a page of user memory. 
In this struct, we utilize several fields to track the location
of a page of memory. 

First, the location filed indicates the location of the 
page if it is not loaded into a frame of physical memory. 
If we have a file page, we use the file*, and offset
fields to know where the page resides on disk. If we have 
a swap location, we use the swap index to track the location
of the page in the swap space. 

Finally, when the page is in physical memory, we also track
it with the struct frame* field, which points to the 
struct frame that manages the physical memory location for where
that page resides. Thus, in order
to find the location of the data for a page, we first 
check if the page is loaded via the is_loaded field. If true, 
we consult the struct* frame to determine the location 
of the data. Else, we consult the location external to physical
memory, as outlined above. 

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

As mentioned in the section and the project spec, there is always
at least two memory mapping from virtual memory addresses to 
physical memory, as the kernel and user virtual memory addresses
reference physical memory. 

When checking the accessed and dirty bits for a page, we therefore
have to be aware of this aliasing issue. To avoid this problem, we always
check the bits for the user virtual address, but using the page_id in the
site struct, which is the page number (i.e. the rounded down version) of the
user virtual address.

Additionally, when implementing sharing further complicates this
matter. To implement sharing, we updated the struct frame 
resident page field to be a list of site structs. Now, when checking
the accessed bits, we do so for each of the page_id fields in the 
corresponding site structs, making sure to use the owner_thread
pagedir for each respective spte. If we find at least one that is set
we reset them all to 0, and move on. Else, if they are all 0, we update
the struct info for each site, and then evict the frame. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

There are several major cases to consider. The first is the case
where the system is out of frames, and so we will need to evict
two frames to handle the requests. The second case is where
there is one frame remaining that is currently not being
used. In this case, we simply return the free
frame, and then evict an in use frame to handle the request. 
The third case is where the system has two or more
free frames. In this case, we simply return two unique frames to 
handle the request. 

In each of these cases, race conditions can occur, because the
frames are global frames, and thus constitute a shared resource. 
Thus, given multiple consumers of a shared resource, we have to ensure
that at any given time, only one of the consumers can consume, 
so that the state of the shared resource is consistent, and that
if a consumer wants a shared resource and none are available
it takes appropriate action. 

To do this, we use two different locks. The first is a global lock
called frame_evict_lock which acts as a protection mechanism around
the frame table. We acquire this lock to coordinate access to the frame
table. Specifically, during eviction, we can only have a single
thread operate the clock hand at a time. To enforce this
we acquire the frame_evict_lock before attempting eviction
to ensure that a single pass over the frame table is made
in each clock cycle. 

The second lock, is actually many locks, but each serves the same
function. Specifically, we place a lock within each frame, to serve
as a synchronization mechanism on a frame struct that manages information
about a given frame of physical memory. Thus, a thread must
acquire the frame lock before writing or reading
information about physical frame of memory. 

Note, as stated in the assignment spec, we also ensured that
our design allows for parallelism. Once a thread acquires the
frame lock for the frame it is going to consult, said thread
releases the frame_evict_lock, which allows other threads
to consult the frame table as needed. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We designed both the spte and frame structs with two specifications
in mind. We wanted to ensure that we tracked all of the needed
state information for a given page or physical frame. We also wanted
to do it in as little space as possible, while ensuring proper
synchronization and readability. 

In order to provide fast storage and fast lookup, we opted
to use a hash map to store the supplemental page
table for each thread. We initially considered a list, but the 
list only offers fast insertion, as it requires iteration to 
do extraction. The hash map required more code to write (hash
functions) but is better for performance. 

We also opted to use an array of frame structs allocated in the kernel
to track the physical memory frames. We indexed the array to correspond 
to the frame values returned by palloc to ensure consistency. 
The reason we chose this data structure is that it allows for
ease during eviction. Using this array, the clock algorithm
used in eviction simply sweeps over the array by tracking an idea value of the
current frame to check. One potential criticism
of this design is that it allocates the array, even if
not all frames of physical memory are in use. We considered
this a worthwhile tradeoff over a list of frames that can shrink and grow, 
or any other variable size data structure, which would significantly
complicate eviction.
