---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

To begin, we note that file descriptors are unique within a single 
process. 

To implement the notion of open files within a program, we defined 
the struct file_package. This struct allows us to track all 
pertinent information for a processes open file in a single location. 
Furthermore, these structs contain a list_elem, which allows these
file_packages to be placed in a list. 

Every process contains a list of file_packages, and an int fd_counter.
The fd_counter is set initially to 2, to account for STD_IN and 
STD_OUT. When a file is opened, that file receives the current value
of fd_counter in the thread. Then, fd_counter is incremented. In this
way, every opened file gets a new and unique file descriptor. 

The file descriptor is unique to an open call for a specific file.
As stated in the spec, the file position of a given file may not
consistent across all fd's for a given file. Therefore, we track 
a file position within the file_package struct as well, which 
associated with the unique fd. 

It is important to note that we do not recycle used file descriptors
after they have been closed. We do this for the following reasons:
1. You can imagine a user program that requests to open a file, 
receives a file descriptor, and then closes the file. Later the 
program opens another file, and receives the recycled fd. However,
the coder, in a lapse of judgement, mistakenly associates the new
fd with the closed file. In this case, the recycled fd will now be
valid, only it will be associated with a different file, thus
making the error harder to catch. Thus, we make fd's unique for each 
call to open. 
2. If we were to recycle fd's it would require more code and some
sort of Data structure. This will inevitably come at a cost. 
3. As posted on the course group page, we assume that no user program
will ever open more than INT_MAX -2 files. Given this assumption, 
there is no reason to recycle fd's, considering the cost of point 2, 
and the potential debugging issues of point 1. 


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Reading and writing user data in the kernel is incredibly dangerous, 
because the user data could be null, in an unmapped region, or
not in the user's space. In each of these cases, we have to take
precaution to ensure that we do not

max of 2


What is this asking?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

- NEED TO ADD LOCK TWO LOCKS AROUND PARENT_IS_FINISHED AND CHILD_IS_FINISHED


Do we do this effectively? 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?


What is this asking? 

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We didn't change it. Should we have?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
